[How Does Google Hire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-baHBzWe4k)
  - Will hire anyone that is smart/knowledgeable, independent of background
  - Remember: They want to like you, and want to help you shine
  - Your resume should be consise w/ no mistakes. Bullet points should convey impact
  - If your application makes the cut, you'll be emailed by a recruiter to set up phone conversation (discuss background, goals, etc)
  - If you didn't creep out the recruiter too much, you'll make it to the technical interview (coding will ensue)
  - If that tehcnical interview goes alright, you will get invited for an on-site interview
  - On-Site: 4-5 interviews on data structures, algorithms, coding, and/or machine learning!
  - If enough of the on-site people agree that you're definitely decent, you application packet (resume, work samples, interviews) moves on to the hiring committee. 
  - If the hiring committee doesn't deem you unfit, your application packet moves on to a senior-level Googler for final approval
  - If that person agrees with all those who have come before him, then --- you're hired!
  - > "That's a brief synopsis of how we hire here at Google."
  
  
 [Prepare for a Google Engineering Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko-KkSmp-Lk)
  - Make sure you can prove everything you've written on your resume
  - Know data structures, algorithms, hashtables, stacks, arrays, algorithmic space and time complexity
  - Be prepared to code on a whiteboard (practice on one!)
  - Brush up on system design and object-oriented programming
  - Demonstrate problem-solving skills:  think outloud, start with brute force and think through better ideas; discuss other possibilities
  - Coding: Be very familiar w/ at least one language (C, C++, Java, Python)
    * Know APIs, OO design, how to test your code, how to think through corner/edge cases for your code (and other people's code)
  - Complexity: Know the time and space complexity of your code, and how to change it
  - Testing Experience:  3+ years in industrusty (you should know it); 2- years (you'll be assessed on your testing aptitude)
    * how would you unit test the code you write?
    * what interesting inputs or test cases can you think of?
    * how to include security or improve performance...? 
  - Data Structures: Super Important
    * Study up on as many as humanly possible
    * Know most famous classes on NP-Complete problems (traveling salesman, knapsack)
    * Trees, tree construction, tree traversal, hashtables, stacks, arrays, linked lists
  - Basic Discrete Math:  counting problems (combinatorics, n choose k), probability
  - Recursion
    * practice problems that can be solved iteratively, but have a more elegant recursive solution
  - Operating Systems
    * understand processes, threads, and concurrency issues, and everything related (mutexes, sempaphores, locks, etc)
    * understand resource allocation
    * understand context switching
    * how does scheduling work?
  - System Design
    * those in industry 5+ yrs will be tested
  - Clarify any questions
    * questions are intentionally vague b/c interviewer wants to know how you would think in a real-world situation
    * e.g., are there any time or space complexity requirements?
  - Keep Thinking and Generating Ideas Outloud
    * your first solution might not be the best
    * keep poking holes in it and refining your approach
