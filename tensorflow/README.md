Some projects to work on:

There are some cool projects from Stanford's [cs224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) I could look more into, try
to replicate, and/or use as motivation for other ideas.

e.g., 

* Deanonymizing Quora Answers
* Learning Sentence Vector Representations to Summarize Yelp Reviews
 - inspired idea: summarize paragraphs in books:  make books shorter! :-p

Restaurant Menu Generation From User Reviews
 - idea for work: description of a wrestler from fan coments

GRUV: Algorithmic Music Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks ( and video )
* inspired idea: create musics = fuck yea

Deep Learning For Mathematical Functions
* fucking cool

End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Automatic Speech Recognition
* idea for work: which wrestler is talking?


Cool Project: Mathematical Analysis via Image Processing
* maybe this can be trained on MNIST first
* I give an image, say 8+9, and it gives me back most probable answer (17)
* has to recognize 0-9 and {+,-,*,/}
* can make it a phone app....but not super important (people already have calculators)
* a phone app would be when it can look at an integral and solve :-p
