So R and Rstudio are working great!  But at one point you update something.  
Or maybe it's that you don't.  You get an error message about it.  So you update a few things,
thinking you're "healing" things.

But, wait -- wtf?  Now one of your packages doesn't load properly.  Or a function in your package
throws errors when it never did before?  What's going on?

Fact is, I don't totally know... So I have to investigate.
